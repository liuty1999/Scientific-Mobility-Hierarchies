This repository provides relevant data and code to reproduce the findings in the manuscript "Structural hierarchies in the intercity mobility network of global scientists".
This repository develops as four parts of spatial hierarchy, node hierarchy, compositional flow hierarchy, and directional flow hierarchy, corresponding one by one to the four sections in Results in the manuscript.
If you need to reuse any intermediate data from this repository, please obtain prior authorization from me or the corresponding author of the article.
